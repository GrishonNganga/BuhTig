# BuhTig

This application makes it easy to find users and repositories on Github. 

#### By **Grishon Gikima**

## Description

This application allows a user to search for a Github's user and or repositories by using Github's API. A user first sees my Github account on the `/home` page and repositories listed on the `/repositories` page. The user can serach for a user or repo on the search bar up top. With one caveat however. ~Being on the homepage one can search for users only, and being on the repositories pagas well can only search for repositories.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

`git clone https://github.com/GrishonNganga/BuhTig.git`\
`cd BuhTig`

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Known Bugs

When a user searches for a user or repos, they only get the top result displayed. The current design does not allow for that but can be done.
